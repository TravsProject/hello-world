First Repository!

Hello everyone, Travis here!

Ive decided to take some time off of college to try and learn about several different things in life and this seems to have ended up on the list of things! I have maintained a 3.3 gpa for about a year and a half but am just not as interested as I was in my first semester. I am doing this in hopes of learning the basics of coding.
